# duckduckgo-bang-counter

### Status

1. Bang is completely stored correctly 
2. Add and reset work properly
3. Got a decent icon

TODO:
1. Build out UI which shows the users bang counter

MAYBE TODO:
1. When you do "search !g" on duckduckgo, you can intercept the request to google and it will record its
origin url as duckduckgo. This could be leveraged in some way.
