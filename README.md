# duckduckgo-bang-counter

### Status

1. When we use a bang, this appears to get stored in storage properly.
2. The reset button works as expected

TODO:
1. Get a fitting icon
2. Build out UI which shows the users bang counter
3. We need a non bang counter also; that is, normal duckduckgo searches
4. look into https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest
